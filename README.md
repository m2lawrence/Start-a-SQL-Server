# Start-a-SQL-Server

When your website won't work because your Microsoft SQL Server hasn't automatically started, do this:

1. LC View Tab at top.
2. LC Registered Servers, or Ctrl+Alt+G.
3. Inside the "Local Server Groups" folder is my SQL Server, RC on it and LC Service Control and LC Start. 
4. The red bubble on the server should no turn green and start running ok.
5. Select your database "mike" from the top left dropdown list, to see your tables.
